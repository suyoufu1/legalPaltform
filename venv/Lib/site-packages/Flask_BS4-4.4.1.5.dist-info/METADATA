# Flask-BS4

***This is a fork of [Flask-Bootsrap](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Bootstrap/) upgraded to Bootstrap 4.x.x.***

Flask-Bootstrap packages [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) into an extension that mostly consists of a blueprint named `bootstrap`. It can also create links to serve Bootstrap from a CDN and works with no boilerplate code in your application.


## Usage

Here is an example:

```python
from flask_bs4 import Bootstrap

[...]

Bootstrap(app)
```

This makes some new templates available, containing blank pages that include all bootstrap resources, and have predefined blocks where you can put your content.

As of version 3, Flask-Bootstrap has a [proper documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap), which you can check for more details.

## Sample App

Welcome to the Flask-BS4 sample app. This will give you an overview
of how the Flask-BS4 package can render different types of input fields.

First you should create a virtual environment. I prefer using:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

To run this application yourself, please install its requirements first:

```bash
$ pip install -r sample_app/requirements.txt
```

Then, you can actually run the application. Optionally you can set
`FLASK_ENV=development`.

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=sample_app
$ flask run
```

Afterwards, point your browser to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000),
then check out the source.
